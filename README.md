2D Shadows implemented in Dart
==========
This shadows example was written in [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/).

Below is an image running inside of [Dartium](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/dartium/) and edited with [Dart Editor](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/editor/).
I wrote a document on how it works [2D shadows in Dart](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sCqW4IB1I8bryzSdSKDUHv_Sul79gFILte2LmG07A1g/edit?usp=sharing).

It sole purpose was to help me learn [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/). If you have an questions feel free to contact me: <william.quartz@gmail.com>.
